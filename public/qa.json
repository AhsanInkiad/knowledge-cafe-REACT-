      "question":"Props vs State",
      "answer":"We pass data from a parent component to a child component by using props. They are immutable. We can think of it as the inputs to a component.State is used to store data that can later be modified by the component. In summary, props are used to pass data through parent to a child component, and by state we manage data that can change inside a component."

      "question":"How does useState work?",
      "answer":"We use useState instead of using variable, because when a change is made in variable, react js do not recognize that. So we use useState as it reRenders the DOM, and thus react can recognize the difference."
